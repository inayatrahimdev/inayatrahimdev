# Hi, I'm Inayat Rahim

I'm a BS Artificial Intelligence student who enjoys building things, breaking them, and then figuring out why they broke.

Most of my time goes into learning AI fundamentals properly — not just running models, but understanding how data flows, how decisions are made, and where systems fail. I’m still early in the journey, but I’m serious about it.

## What I’m currently working on

Right now I’m focusing on:

- Machine Learning basics (regression, classification, evaluation)
- Neural networks and how they actually learn
- Computer vision using OpenCV and CNNs
- Getting comfortable with transformers and attention
- Cleaning messy datasets and making sense of them
- Writing better, more readable Python code

I prefer learning by building small, working systems instead of jumping straight into big frameworks.

## Projects

This profile mostly contains learning-driven projects.  
They may not be perfect, but they reflect real understanding and experimentation.

Some things you’ll find here:
- AI chatbots and basic NLP pipelines  
- Image classification and vision projects  
- End-to-end ML workflows (data → model → evaluation)  
- University and personal experiments

I try to keep code readable and explain things in comments or README files.

## How I approach learning

I usually follow this process:

1. Understand the problem and the data
2. Start with a simple baseline
3. Check where it fails
4. Improve step by step
5. Document what I learned

This helps me avoid blindly copying solutions.

## What I’m aiming for

I’m actively looking for:
- AI / ML internships  
- Junior-level AI or data roles  
- Environments where learning and mentorship matter

I’m flexible with time and willing to put in the effort to grow.
